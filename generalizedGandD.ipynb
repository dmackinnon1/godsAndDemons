    "# generalized gods and demons\n",
    "Inspired by Raymond Smullyan's \"Gods, fter deamons, and mortals\" puzzles from *To Mock a Mockingbird, and other logic puzzles*. These puzzles are similar to the familiar \"knights and knave\" puzzles.\n",
    "> Shortly after Inspector Craig returned to London from his strange experience in Subterranea, he had a curious dream... Craig dreamed he spent nine days in a region in which dwelled gods, deamons and mortals. The gods of course, always told the truth, and the demons always lied. As to the mortals half were knights and half were knaves. As usual, the knights told the truth and the knaves lied."
